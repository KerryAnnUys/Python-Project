    "Introduction to the Coding Program:\n",
    "\n",
    "The following program will allow any user to make use of it at all times. This specific Python program will enable a user to search a movie title and the program will then print a response and provide the user with in depth and important information about a specific movie. This information includes but is not limited to, the year it was released, a short summary of the plot, the runtime of the film, the genre, directors,writers, actors, the language/s that it can be watched in, as well as the different awards won, etc. All the information that the program provides will help the user to gain a thorough understanding of each movie, thus allowing individuals to also be able to conduct research on the movies with all the information that the program will provide. Furthermore, the python program has been designed in a very specific way in order to ensure that it is very simple and to the point, thus allows users to be able to easily interact with the program without getting confused. Before the user can interact with the program, the program has been designed in a way that it will first display a short and concise introduction on how one should use the program in order for it to work correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logic of the Code Program:\n",
    "\n",
    "The following information will provide a thorough explanation on the thought process of the different codes used throughout the program, and will then further go into depth with explaining how the entire coding works together to print the correct response to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in desgining the code was to use the request function. In order for the request function to work and to be used throughout the code, one will have to import requests. You cannot use the function if it has not yet been imported into the program. When one uses the 'import requests' function, it provides an easy and straightforward way to be able to interact with webpages and API's. The request function is a well known and used third party library for making HTTP requests. When importing requests, there are further benefits for the program. Such as, it provides access to several other functions and allows you to perform operations. A very common operation used is the 'requests.get' function in order to be able to easily access vital information from URL's. The reason as to why I have imported this function is because I have used the requests.get function in my code which will further be elaborated on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, I have imported json into my program. Json is a built in function in python and is used to transmit and store information in the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the entire program, the OMDB (Open Movie Database) API has been used in order for the program to be able to successfully obtain the required movie information from the database. Additionally, the use of the OMDB API allows for this information to be interacted with throughout the program and python. In order to use this function in my code, I have had to import the omdb function at the beginning of my code. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next step within my code, is to import os. When importing the operating system function, it provides access to the functions found within the operating system, such as file and directory functions. In my code above, I have imported this function in order to specifically make use of the os.listdir() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, to make my code slightly creative and original I have imported the time function. The reasoning for this was to print out my instructions to the user in a way that was creative. Instead of my program printing out the instructions all at once, i have used the time function and have implemented intervals between each letter so that when the program prints the response, it will print out each letter one after another. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, I have imported the OMDBClient function from OMDB. The purpose of this is to be able to interacte with the omdbclient directly without having to prefix it everytime when it is used. This is very convenient and makes the code easier to read. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next step in my code is my API key. This is necassary because the omdb function requires your unique API key to access the omdb API. In other words it is needed for authentication purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to this, I have decided to display brief instructions to the user before they begin to interact with the program. This is to ensure that the user is aware of how to correctly use the program in order for their response to be successful and what they wanted. I decided to make this aspect of my card more creative. This was done by getting the response to be typed out to the user. The aim of this was to try and get the user to engage with the instructions as well as to grab their attention to ensure that they read the instructions word for word. In order for this to be done correctly, i made use of a for loop to ensure that each letter in the instructions is printed out to the user until there are no more letters left t print out. The for loop ends when there are no more letters in the instructions. Additonally, I have made use of the flush function. The flush function is to ensure that the response does not experience any form of buffering when displaying the ouput. It helps to ensure that the display is smooth and successful. I have also implemented the time.sleep function to be able to indicate to the program how long each interval between the letters are. I used 0.01 seconds to ensure that the response is not too slow and bores the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next step in my code, was to ensure that the user felt welcome and to ensure that they were persoanlly able to engage with my program. Thus, i asked for user_input to allow the user to enter their name and then present them with a welcome message followed by their name. \n",
    "\n",
    "I then used the os.listdir() function in my code. The point of this function was to ensure that all the prevoius movie titles that had been searched would save to a txt file. I then printed out these files to the user, so that they would be able to view all the previously searched movies and make a decision if they would want to view a movie that had already been searched or I also gave the user the option to search a completely new movie title. However, due to other file name also stored in this directory, I implemented the '.remove' function into my code. This was to remove all files that were not movie titles. This was to esnure that when all the previous titles were printed out to the user, that unimportant information would not be printed out as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, I provided the user with three different options to choose from. I then used the input function and gave the user the option to choose either 1,2, or 3. 1 being to view previous titles searched, 2 being to search a new movie title and 3 gives them the option to quit the program to avoid the kernel from dying each time. In order to make this easy for the user to read, i used the '\\n' function to print out each option onto a different line. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to ensure that the program continously prompts the user to enter in a movie title, i have implemented a while loop. i also made use of if and else to avoid the program from crashing. For example, if the user entered in a '2', which is to enter a new movie title, the program would ask them to enter in a few movie title. However if the user enters in a '3', which is to quit, the program would automatically break and stop asking the user for input. Else the program will automatically get the information on the movie that the user has entered. i have used the params function in order to indicate to the program the exact information that I need it to include into the response of each movie. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, i have used try and except to avoid the program from displaying error codes and crashing completely. I have coded the program to get data on each movie. I have firstly used the 'with open' function to open the file in write mode. When using write mode, if the file has not already been created, write mode will create the file and then saves all information into the file. I have also used 'with open' because it is a shortcut and prevents me from having to close the file after. I have made use of %s:%s in order to create placeholders for the movie information. Furthermore, i have made use of the \\n to print all the key values onto seperate lines in the dictionary. i have then used the line.rstrip() function to remove all white spaces from the response. This is to ensure that the response is presented neatly to the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "Within the try and except function, i have coded the program to present a message to the user when they enter in an invalid movie title as well as asks the user to re-enter in a movie title. This was to esnure that if the user did not enter in a valid movie title, the system would not end up crashing and could continue. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, if the user inputs a 1, it gives them the option to choose a movie title from the above list that includes all previous searches. If they wish to quit, the program will stop running. however, i have used try and except to prevent the program from crashing when a user enters a movie title that is not included in the previous list. Instead, the program will print out a error message to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overview on Data Collection:\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the entire program, an API has been used. API stands for application programming interface. A API is a softare that sends data to and from websites, users and apps. It contains several different functions which gives permission to certain applications to access data and interact with servers. It further helps to deliver requests from users to a system and then transfers the systems response to the user. API's play a vital role in ensuring the integration of all systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "The OMDB API is a public API that can be accessed by any one. It provides in depth information on movies, TV shows and series. The OMDB API takes users input and collects data based off of the users input. The aim is to provide the user with the information that is up to date and is what they need and are requesting. To interact with the OMDB API, one needs to use the request function. The API then processers users requests and returns back information to fufill their request. \n",
    "\n",
    "Problems Encountered:\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout completing this program, I encountered several problems. The first one being that a dictionary has no attribute for response code. This problem took a while to figure out. I treid many different ways, used different punctuation as well as used different functions. However, with a lot of time dedicated to research and going through lecture notes, i was able to overcome this problem and use the correct parenthesis. Secondly, i received many syntax errors. However, these problems are ones that i find i often experience when coding but i also find them easy to overcome. By reading over my codes it is often easy to identify what i did wrong and thus i can quickly change it. Another problem that occurred was trying to ensure that the program would not crash when user input was invalid or incorrect. This took trial and error to figure out. However, in the end I used if and else as well as try and except to overcome this problem. Lastly, my code continously printed random file names in the prevoius movie titles that were searched. However i overcame this problem by implementing the .remove function to get rid of them.\n",

    "There are many ways that i can try to improve my code. As someone who is still learning, i know that there is always room for improvement. For example, my code could have been more creative. I added one aspect to make it original, however i could of added more to make it creative. Another imporovement that can be made is making my code easy to read by others. For example, using clearer names to name my functions and files so that others can easily identify everything within my code. \n",
